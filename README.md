# language-service

This package implements a TypeScript language service plugin that allows additional refactors and diagnostics with your VSCode editor (or any editor that supports TypeScript's LSP).

## Installation

1. `npm install @effect/language-service --save-dev` in your project
2. inside your tsconfig.json, you should add the plugin configuration as follows:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@effect/language-service"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

3. Ensure that you set your editor to use your workspace TypeScript version.

   - In VSCode you can do this by pressing "F1" and typing "TypeScript: Select TypeScript version". Then select "Use workspace version".
   - In JetBrains you may have to disable the Vue language service, and chose the workspace version of TypeScript in the settings from the dropdown.
   - In NVim with nvim-vtsls you should refer to [how to enable TypeScript plugins in vstls](https://github.com/yioneko/vtsls?tab=readme-ov-file#typescript-plugin-not-activated)

And you're done! You'll now be able to use a set of refactor and diagnostics that targets Effect!

## Provided functionalities

### Quickinfo

- Show the extended type of the current Effect
- Hovering yield\* of Effect.gen will show the Effect type parameters
- Hovering a variable assignment of a type Layer, will show info on how each service got involve
- Hovering a layer, will attempt to produce a graph

### Diagnostics

- Better error readability when you're missing errors or service types in your Effect definitions
- Floating Effects that are not yielded or run
- Wrong usage of yield inside Effect.gen
- Unnecessary usages of Effect.gen
- Multiple versions of Effect in your project

### Completions

- Autocomplete 'Self' in Effect.Service, Context.Tag, Schema.TaggedClass, Schema.TaggedRequest and family
- Autocomplete Effect.gen with `function*(){}`

### Refactors

- Transform an async function definition, into an Effect by using Effect.gen.
- Transform an async function definition, into an Effect by using Effect.gen, and generating a tagged error for each promise call.
- Transform a function returning an Effect.gen into a Effect.fn
- Function calls to pipe: Transform a set of function calls to a pipe() call.
- Pipe to datafirst: Transform a pipe() call into a series of datafirst function calls (where available).
- Toggle return type signature: With a single refactor, adds or removes type annotations from the definition.
- Remove unnecessary `Effect.gen` definitions that contains a single `yield` statement.
- Wrap an `Effect` expression with `Effect.gen`

### Miscellaneous
- "Go to definition" for RpcClient will resolve to the Rpc definition

## Options

Few options can be provided alongside the initialization of the Language Service Plugin.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@effect/language-service",
        "diagnostics": true, // controls Effect diagnostics (default: true)
        "quickinfo": true, // controls quickinfo over Effect (default: true)
        "completions": true, // controls Effect completions (default: true)
        "allowedDuplicatedPackages": [] // list of package names that has effect in peer dependencies and are allowed to be duplicated (default: [])
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Why diagnostics does not appear at compile time?

TypeScript LSP are loaded only while editing your files. That means that if you run `tsc` in your project, the plugin won't be loaded and you'll miss out on the Effect diagnostics.

HOWEVER, if you use `ts-patch` you can enable the transform as well to get the diagnostics also at compile time.
Your `tsconfig.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "plugins": [
      {
        "name": "@effect/language-service",
        "transform": "@effect/language-service/transform" // enables diagnostics at compile time when using ts-patch
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To get diagnostics you need to install `ts-patch` which will make it possible to run `tspc`.

Running `tspc` in your project will now also run the plugin and give you the diagnostics at compile time.
Effect diagnostics will be shown only after standard TypeScript diagnostics has been satisfied.

```ts
$ npx tspc
index.ts:3:1 - error TS3: Effect must be yielded or assigned to a variable.

3 Effect.succeed(1)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Found 1 error in index.ts:3Â 
```

## Configuring diagnostics

You can either disable or change the severity of specific diagnostics by using comments in your code.

```ts
// @effect-diagnostics effect/floatingEffect:off
Effect.succeed(1); // This will not be reported as a floating effect

// @effect-diagnostics effect/floatingEffect:error
Effect.succeed(1); // This will be reported as a floating effect
```
