ServiceMap.Service<LeakingService>("LeakingService")
13:26 - 13:78 | 2 | Methods of this Service require `FileSystem` from every caller.

This leaks implementation details into the service's public type — callers shouldn't need to know *how* the service works internally, only *what* it provides.

Resolve these dependencies at Layer creation and provide them to each method, so the service's type reflects its purpose, not its implementation.

To suppress this diagnostic for specific dependency types that are intentionally passed through (e.g., HttpServerRequest), add `@effect-leakable-service` JSDoc to their interface declarations (e.g., the `FileSystem` interface), not to this service.
