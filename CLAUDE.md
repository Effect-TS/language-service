## MANDATORY STEPS
- After any write to a TypeScript .ts file, run "pnpm lint-fix"

## Repo structure
- Tests for diagnostics are placed inside the examples/diagnostic folder, and the name should start with the rule name
  e.g. for rule "floatingEffect" the file name of the test should be either "floatingEffect.ts" or "floatingEffect_xxxx.ts" where xxxx is anything.
