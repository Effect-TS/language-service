Effect.runSync
14:20 - 14:34 | 2 | Using Effect.runSync inside an Effect is not recommended. Effects inside generators can usually just be yielded.    effect(runEffectInsideEffect)

Effect.runPromise
22:4 - 22:21 | 2 | Using Effect.runPromise inside an Effect is not recommended. The same runtime should generally be used instead to run child effects.
Consider extracting the Runtime by using for example Effect.runtime and then use Runtime.run* with the extracted runtime instead.    effect(runEffectInsideEffect)
